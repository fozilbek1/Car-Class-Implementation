# Car-Class-Implementation
This Python code introduces a simple implementation of a Car class using object-oriented programming principles. It defines attributes such as make, model, year, and color, along with methods to simulate driving and stopping the car. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, offering a hands-on approach to understanding class structures and method invocation.
